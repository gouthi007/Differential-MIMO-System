# Differential-MIMO-System

The aim of this project is to generate four independent fading channels using Jake's fading Simulator and use the channels to simulate two different Differential MIMO Systems with 1 and 2 Receivers and study the Symbol Error Rate(SER) as a function of Symbol to Noise Ratio(SNR).
